 I just beefed up my app's security game big time! I revamped how passwords are encrypted for both login and signup. On top of that, I went all out and added extra security layers throughout the entire code. But that's not allâ€”got the whole place organized with slick routes, views, and controllers. My app's not just secure; it's like a high-tech fortress now. Feeling pretty pumped about it!
